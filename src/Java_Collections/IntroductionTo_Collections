Java collections framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which helps in storing and processing data more efficently .

this framework has alot of useful classes which has tons of useful methods/Functions that makes the programmers task more easy.

Types of Collections : 

1. LIST
2. SET
2. MAP

============================================   LIST COLLECTIONS  ==========================================================
 
			List is an interface of ordered collection (Sequence) which may contain Duplicate Elements
			
							CLASSES THAT IMPLEMENT LIST INTERFACE :
						
											a.	ArrayList
											b.	LinkedList
											c.	Vector
									


============================================   SET COLLECTIONS  ============================================================

			Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate Elements , 
			however it makes no gaurantee concerning the order of iteration 
			
			
			
							CLASSES THAT IMPLEMENT LIST INTERFACE :
						
											a.	HashSet
											b.	LinkedHashSet
											c.	TreeSet
			
			
============================================   MAP COLLECTIONS  ============================================================
			
			Map is an object that maps keys to values,A Map	connot contain duplicate keys

				CLASSES THAT IMPLEMENT LIST INTERFACE :
						
											a.	HashMap
											b.	LinkedHashMap
											c.	TreeMap
			
Difference between hashmap and hashtable 

1. Synchronization and thread safe : if a multiple thread uses hashmap then Synchronization issue will occur
									 i.e. 1 thread has to wait for another thread to release the hashmap values
									 whereas Hashtable synchronization issue does not occur as 2nd thread waits for 1st threead to realese 
									 hashtable entries 
									 
									 
2. Null Key and Values : Hashmap allows null key or null value
						 however Hashtable does not allow null key or null value
						 
						 
3.iterator type :  hashmap uses iterator inorder to iterate through the elements/Keyvalue pair
				   however hashtable uses enumerator just like vecot to traverse through keyvalue pair
